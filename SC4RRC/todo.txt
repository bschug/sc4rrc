
Aspect Ration for Perlin Noise
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Problem:
	Perlin Noise currently works by mapping a regular grid with random height
	values at the vertices to the heightmap. The regular grid is always a 
	square in the current implementation. This may lead to stretching artifacts
	when creating maps that deviate strongly from that square shape.

  Solution:
	Incorporate the heightmap's aspect ratio in the addFrequency method.
	The grid should then be created not in a square shape but in a shape 
	similar to the heightmap.
	
	
Water Percentage Adjustment Is Too Slow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Problem:
	Adjusting the height values in such a way that the exact percentage that 
	the user has defined is under water requires copying all height values into
	a list and sorting that list. This can take quite some time for large maps.

  Solution:
	Either a completely new approach has to be found or at least the list
	creation step can be adjusted in such a way that the values are added into
	the list in a sorted order already.
	

Use Second Derivative for Displacement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Problem:
	Strong displacements on an already strongly bent surface may lead to
	unnaturally steep ledges and bents in the landscape. 
	
  Solution:
	If I could find a way to determine the second derivative of the terrain 
	surface at the point, I could use that as a factor in the displacement.
