/** Fractal terrain generator using a pregenerated triangle grid.
 *	This terrain generator uses the diamond-square algorithm to subdivide the
 *	map into a set of triangles with random height shifts applied to the 
 *	vertices.
 *	First, the rectangular map is split into two triangles. The vertices of 
 *	these triangles are moved up or down by a random amount. Then, depending
 *	on the detail level, the triangles are split into four new triangles again
 *	and again, applying a random shift to the newly created vertices each time.
 *
 *	This terrain generator has a few weaknesses, however: The most problematic
 *	one is its enormous memory hunger, especially on higher detail levels. This
 *	is because it pre-builds the whole random triangle grid and keeps it in 
 *	memory until the intial (unfiltered) heightmap has been drawn. The other 
 *	problem is that the resulting landscape often still looks quite "edgy",
 *	even after blurring it. This is a problem of the underlying triangle grid
 *	algorithm.
 *
 *	Just don't use this one anymore, it's hopelessly deprecated.
 *	I just keep it in here because it is easy to understand and if you 
 *	understand this one, you will also understand the DynamicTriangleGrid.
